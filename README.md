# YouTube to MP3/MP4 Downloader

An easy-to-use desktop application to download YouTube videos as MP3 (audio) or MP4 (video) using a clean GUI built with `customtkinter`.

This was my final project for **CS50P: INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING WITH PYTHON**. However, this is an improved and refactored version of the project, designed for more convenient use. The current version migrated from [pytubefix](https://github.com/JuanBindez/pytubefix) to [ytp-dl](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) + [codexffmpeg](https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases/tag/2025-06-11-git-f019dd69f0).
