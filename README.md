# YT to MP3 

A tiny, sloppy, slightly janky GUI that pulls the audio container from a YouTube video and drops it in your Downloads folder. I found this script deep in my files, Its pretty old so I doubt it would still work consistently.

## What it does

* Paste a YouTube URL and click **Search** to fetch title + thumbnail.
* Click **Download as mp3** to download the audio stream the downloader returns (often `.webm` / `.m4a` â€” not always a true `.mp3`).
* Minimal, unpolished.
